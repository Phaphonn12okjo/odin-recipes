# odin-recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project
. The assignment was to create a simple recipe website using only HTML.

About the Project

At first, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but after going through the curriculum I got a clearer picture of the requirements. The project turned out to be more enjoyable than I thought — I even added extra elements beyond the assignment just to experiment and have fun.

What I Learned

Structuring a webpage with semantic HTML

Creating multiple pages and linking them together

Organizing content for readability

Exploring creativity by going beyond the minimum requirements

Reflection

This project is just the beginning, and I’m looking forward to the upcoming assignments in The Odin Project. Building this recipe site gave me a solid foundation and confidence to continue learning.
